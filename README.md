# PlayCanvas Engine + TypeScript Starter

A Vite-powered PlayCanvas Engine project with TypeScript, hot module replacement, ESLint and Prettier.

## Spinning Cube

A rotating cube, a camera and a directional light. It is the smallest PlayCanvas scene in the catalog.

### Controls

The scene runs automatically; no input is required.

## Prerequisites

Node.js 22.23.2 or later.

## Getting started

```bash
npm create playcanvas@latest playcanvas-project -- --format engine
cd playcanvas-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>. Edit the files under `src/` and save to see the scene update.

## Scripts
